# Nouveau must be disabled to load the nvidia kernel module:

blacklist nouveau

# Make a soft dependency for nvidia-uvm as adding the module loading to
# /usr/lib/modules-load.d/nvidia-uvm.conf for systemd consumption, makes the
# configuration file to be added to the initrd but not the module, throwing an
# error on plymouth about not being able to find the module.
# Ref: /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/00systemd/module-setup.sh

# Even adding the module is not the correct thing, as we don't want it to be
# included in the initrd, so use this configuration file to specify the
# dependency.

# Added also nvidia-drm since on some machines it didn't get loaded
# automatically, which resulted in Wayland sessions falling back
# to simpledrm (slow!), external monitors and switcherooctl not
# working at all.
